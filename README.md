# gradle-cumulative

This project contains various Gradle tasks for a typical project baseline that I have experience with at work or how I normally set up a baseline when I do my own personal development. A summary listed below.

1. Single-project Eclipse view without Gradle plugin
2. Configuring subprojects with project name gradle build file (rather than 'build.gradle')
3. Subproject Java builds that jar source, test, and all classes and Java sources
4. Manifest file manipulation

... (Others will come as soon as I do a quick clean up of my personal projects)
